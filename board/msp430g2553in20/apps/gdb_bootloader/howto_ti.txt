This latest version of the gdb_bootloader code now works properly with TI binaries.
However, you must enable the CCS eclipse output to Intel Hex feature.  Once enabled,
CCS will create a projectname.hex file in the binary directory.

Instead of using the gdb 'load' commnand to upload to flash, you must use the gdb 'restore'
command preceded by an 'eraseflash' command.  See the following example session
that uploads the generated hex file 'tiblink.hex' to flash from a project called tiblink:

$ msp430-gdb -l 2 -b 9600 -ex 'target remote /dev/ttyUSB0'
