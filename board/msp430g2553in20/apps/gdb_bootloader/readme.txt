Inspiration:
I was looking at making a small msp430fr5739 based board. Originally I
thought I would be able to use the msp430g2 launchpad to program them. However,
I hit a snag in that they don't seem to recognize the msp430fr5739 as a
valid device. I can use my msp430fr5720 launchpad to program them but not the $10
launchpad. Then there was all the hubbub about the new msp430g2955 chips
and it got me thinking. Why should I let Texas Instruments determine
how I program my chips?

Investigation:
I spent some time looking at BSL and then got discouraged trying to find a client
that works on Windows, linux and OSX. It mostly seemed like it was going
to be a hassle. (although this has changed now as mspdebug works with serial BSL)
Then I got to thinking about just using GDB and its Remote Serial Protocol. If
you use msp430-gdb and mspdebug, you use this interface over a local server socket.
However, an often unnoticed feature of this protocol is that it can also be used
with a regular serial port.

Solution:
I decided to try and implement a gdb stub server on the msp430g2553 as a proof
of concept. You load the gdb code in high memory on the msp430 chip. You can think
of it as a bootloader that happpens to use the Remote Serial Protocol. This allows
you to load new programs on that chip without the need for a launchpad or an FET.
All you need is a dumb usb->serial port dongle. You can find these on ebay for
about $2-$10. They all go faster than the 9600 baud the virtual serial port the
msp430 g2 launchpad provides. It is likely you probably have one of these already.
This scheme doesn't allow you to debug using msp430-gdb, but it does provide a way
to load new code without having to deal with BSL or having to write any host side code.

How it works:
Load the attached code below on your chip one time. At this point,
you could remove that chip from your launchpad and throw it on a
breadboard. You just need power, the caps and a pull up resistor. Then
connect TX and RX to a serial to USB converter (ftdi, cp102, pl2303hx,
etc..). For simplicity, we can just test with the g2 launchpad itself
and ignore the fact that there is an FET on the board and just use
/dev/ttyACM0 or COM1: on windows.

At reset time, the code looks at the state of the P1.3 button on
the msp430g2553. If you are holding it down, the code starts a gdb
bootload/server running on the msp430g2553. On your linux box, just start
up msp430-gdb to connect to the chip over a serial port. You can't debug,
but what you can do is erase your flash and load a new program. The gdb
server code sits at memory 0xfa00 -> 0xfdff so you do lose some of your
flash. *I've done some optimization see later posts in this thread *

The gdb_bootloader.elf file must be loaded on an msp430g2553. I'll post code
and support for other chips at a later date. I'm excited about this
concept and wanted to let people try it out.

Once you have that installed, you no longer need to use your launchpad
to load new code. To use the gdb bootloader, just connect a usb to serial
dongle to the msp430g2553 directly. Then use a remote serial port to
connect to msp430-gdb. Here are the steps to load a blink program using
msp430-gdb via the serial port:

	$ msp430-gdb -b 9600 -ex 'set remotetimeout 1' -ex 'target remote /dev/ttyACM0' blink.elf

At this point, there are two things on your msp430g2553 chip. At 0xfa00 is
the gdb_bootloader code, it is run first before your blink.elf code. It
checks the button at reset to see if you are holding it down. If not,
then it runs the blink.elf code. If you are holding it down, it runs the
gdb stub server and allows you to reload code using msp430-gdb.

So just press reset to start the blink.

Press and hold the P1.3 switch down then press reset to start the gdb
stub server. The RED led comes on solid if it is ready to accept a
serial gdb connection.

Pretty simple huh? I think so.

The code is written in C++ using my fabooh framework. I've been trying
to find a good app to use as the fabooh debut project. I think this will
be it. This type of code needs to be small but needs the flexibility to
use various UART implementations. This code personifies what fabooh does
well. So expect to see it real soon now, in the fabooh source tree.
