/*
 * goldilocks.cpp - An iterative approach to a more accurate DCO clock using the serial port
 *
 * Desc: This code uses the serial port as an accurate time reference to allow you to
 *       calibrate your DCO clock.
 *
 *       Use a terminal program (putty/screen/hypterminal) to connect this program.
 *       This code waits for you to type a single 'U' character. When received,
 *       it calculates the bit period for each edge transition. It then suggests
 *       value adjustments to your DCOCTL to achieve a more accurate DCO clock.
 *       This technique doesn't require you to solder any XTALS to achieve better
 *       accuracy.
 *
 *       The 'U' ASCII character is special because its value is 0x55 or binary
 *       0b01010101. We use it to capture each edge transition using Timera's
 *       edge capture feature. Serial data is transmitted least significant bit to
 *       most significant. So a 'U' starts with a '1' (lsb of 'U') and then shifts
 *       each bit in until it has sent 8 bits. The serial pins are normally high.
 *       A new RX byte can be detected when the pin goes from high to low. This
 *       is the called the start bit.  Our serial frame is 1 start bit + 8 data
 *       bits + one stop bit (goes back to idling high).
 *
 *       The timera peripheral detects changes in the pin state and triggers an
 *       interrupt providing you the time the transition occurred. This code
 *       keeps track of the transition times for each bit. We average the
 *       duration and decide if our clock is accurate. If your host is sending
 *       bits accurately, the duration of the ones to zeros should be
 *       DCO frequency / baud rate = time period between transitions.
 *
 *       For example: 16000000 Hz / 9600 bps == 1666 cycles or bit period
 *
 *       We ignore the fractional part and just average the duration
 *       for all bits. The actual frequency of your DCO is computed
 *       by multiplying this averaged bit_duration * bps:
 *
 *       1666*9600 = 15993600 Hz
 *
 *       You can tweak the DCOCTL value up or down by setting it in your setup()
 *       function and achieve a more accurate DCO clock speed using this technique.
 *
 *       This code assumes the host serial port is configured for 9600-8-N-1.

 *
 * Note: A special thanks to g0rdon from IRC. This code was inspired by his questions
 *       about edge capture for IR communications using the timerA peripheral. Not
 *       having an IR capture IC handy, I used the serial port to generate some wave forms
 *       using 'U' to test his code. This made me think about using the serial port as a no
 *       setup, quality reference clock to calibrate the DCO. The result is this code.
