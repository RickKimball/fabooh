/*
 * Energia.h - provide a header file so fabooh will work in the Energia IDE
 *
 * Note: You do not need to include this file. It will be automatically
 *       included when needed. This file is only used when you build
 *       within the Energia IDE environment.
 *
 *       Normal development with fabooh should not include this file.
 *       You should just include <fabooh.h> in your source.
