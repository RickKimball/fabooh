   * define STACK_COLOR to enable this feature. RAM is marked with a
   * known value. This is useful to help discover how much stack is
   * being used at runtime.
   *
   * Use mspdebug, run your program, CTRL-C to break after you
   * have exercised all your functions. Use the eXamine gdb cmd:
   *
   *  > x/4xw 0x200
   *
   * press return repeatedly to see the next 4 words. When you
   * stop seeing '0xfeee' that is where the stack ends. Of
   * course if the last thing on the stack has the value of
   * 0xfeee you will get a false reading. In general this
   * is useful.
   *
   * Note: RAM_START 0x200 will hold the data values, followed by
   * allocated heap memory, then the stack. So you can also use
   * this feature to see how much heap memory is used. It doesn't
   * however detect heap - stack collisions.
